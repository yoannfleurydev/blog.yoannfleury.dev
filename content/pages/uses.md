# Softwares

## Editor

### VS Code

I am using VS Code as my main editor as I'm a JavaScript developer, but I love
the comfort of IntelliJ for Java and PhpStorm for PHP if I need to work using
these languages.

I sometimes open Vim for some quick changes in the terminal.

Here is a quick listing of the extensions I installed on my VS Code (minus the
ones specific to languages):

- Clipboard Manager `edgardmessias.clipboard-manager`
- Color Highlight `naumovs.color-highlight`
- EditorConfig for VS Code `editorconfig.editorconfig`
- Error Lens `usernamehw.errorlens`
- [Gitlab Merge Request Upvotes](https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/vscode-gitlab-merge-request-upvotes) `yoannfleurydev.gitlab-merge-request-upvotes`
- GitLens - Git Supercharged `eamodio.gitlens`
- Indent Rainbow `oderwat.indent-rainbow`
- Live Share `ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare`
- Prettier - Code formatter `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- Project Manager `alefragnani.project-manager`
- Template String Converter `meganrogge.template-string-converter`

I use [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) color theme for almost all my
applications and [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as a
monospace font. I have used [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) in the past.

## Terminal

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is my terminal of choice, I have also used [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)
on Linux. As a Shell, I'm using [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) and the prompt
is powered by [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

## Browser

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is my main browser for
personnal usage, and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is the one
